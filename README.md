issue with java 11

prerequisite:
must have java 11 installed and java --version must output java 11.

Just import (drag and drop) this folder into a new vscode window.
You will get errors. and that is an issue that should be solved:
* intellij does not show any error. 
* mvn clean install does not show any error.

--> errors are only in vscode....
